## Data Visualization

### STA 404: Advanced Data Visualization

My projects in STA 404: Advanced Data Visualization by Miami University

**Chicago Crime Data Report**
I investigate the crime dataset from the Chicago Police Department (CDP) between 2001 and 2021 to see the general trends and take a closer look at specific crimes in recent years. I created static plots in R and embedded them in my article.

**Fatal Crashes Data Dashboard**
My team and I explored Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) data collected by The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and developed interactive dashboard in R Shiny App.
