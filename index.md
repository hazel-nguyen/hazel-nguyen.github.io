### STA 404: Advanced Data Visualization

My projects in STA 404: Advanced Data Visualization by Miami University

**Chicago Crime Data Report** [![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/hazel-nguyen/crimes_plots)

I investigate the crime dataset from the Chicago Police Department (CDP) between 2001 and 2021 to see the general trends and take a closer look at specific crimes in recent years. I created static plots in R and embedded them in my article.

**Fatal Crashes Data Dashboard** [![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/hazel-nguyen/crashes_shiny_app)

My team and I explored Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) data collected by The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and developed interactive dashboard in R Shiny App.

## Machine Learning

### Regression 
**Housing Price Prediction** [![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/hazel-nguyen/ames_house_price)
I applied Linear Regression, KNN Regression, Random Forest and other techniques including dimensionality reduction and regularization to choose the best model to predict house price in the Ames Housing dataset.

### Classification
**Travel Insurance Prediction** [![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/hazel-nguyen/logistic_insurance)
I applied logistic regression to predict the likelihood of a customer to purchase travel insurance using the Travel Insurance dataset on Kaggle. 

### Time Series Analysis
**Univariate Time Series Analysis of Drought Data** [![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/hazel-nguyen/time-series-drought)
My team and I analyzed precipitation time series from National Centers for Environmental Information (NOAA) to understand drough patterns. We tried SARIMA, ARIMA, Holt-Winters and sent our report to Undergraduate Statistics Project Competition.

## Deep Learning

### CSE 432: Machine Learning - Introduction to Computer Vision
This course was my first introduction to neural networks and deep learning. I became familiar with Pytorch, Tensorflow and Keras packages through applying CNN models to MNIST and CIFAR datasets. 

**Numpy Implementation of NN with MNIST** 3 Fully-connected layers

**10-layer CNN with CIFAR-10** Batchnorm, LeakyRelu, Convolution, Dropout, AdamW Optimizer

My team and I were given +5GB of survey data from a Research Center about Drug usage. We applied tree regression to select important variables to optimize survey and clustering to identify groups with high risks.

### DataFest 2022 Miami University - Winner
